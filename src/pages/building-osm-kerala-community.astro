					Twenty-three volunteers from OSM community, MG University, Swathandra Malayalam Computing attended the mapping party to map the areas of Koorachundu Panchayat, Kozhikode, Kerala. This was hosted by the Panchayat in an aim to prepare a ward-level map for the upcoming LSGI election. Koorachundu Panchayat Mapathon was the first of its kind that a government body in India (documented) took an initiative to host an event to create a map on a community level. This paved the way for many mapping events to happen from the government side.

        As an extension of a previous mapping party held at Koorachundu Panchayath in 2014, the panchayat decided to host another mapping event to create a rich resource map. National Service Scheme volunteers from three colleges camped in the panchayat from December 22 to 28, 2018. A total of 220 student volunteers were trained to map with OSM. The technical support for the event was provided by OSM Kerala community, Swathantra Malayalam Computing, and Geominds. Various features were added to OSM, focusing on Place Names, Roads, Lanes, Culverts, Bridges, Land Use/Land Cover, Building Footprints, Drinking Water Schemes, Forests, Streams, Rivers, Hot Springs, Ponds, Public Wells, Water Tanks, Tourist, Religious and Recreational Spots, Irrigation, Public Health Systems, and Other Assets. Areas affected by floods and landslides were mapped from a disaster management perspective.

        Members of the OSM Kerala community advocated for the improvement of OSM data in Kerala following the floods in 2018. The community submitted proposals to release important datasets under an OpenData license. Community members reached out to various government officials, including Minister Dr. Thomas Isaac and MLAs like Sabarinathan, Veena George, Shafi Parambil, and VD Satheesan. They also engaged with Potheri Vasudevan Unnikrishnan, Strategic Advisor at the Kerala Development Innovation Strategic Council.
        On August 28, 2018, a proposal to the Kerala government for releasing data for use in OSM was jointly written by community members in OSM Kerala and friends in CIS. The proposal was submitted to the then IT Secretary, IT Mission director, and ICFOSS Director. In-person meetings were held to discuss the proposal.
        Parallel efforts were made to create the Kerala OpenData portal, which was discussed with the then IT Mission Director Sambasiva Rao by OSM Kerala community member User:Naveenpf. A presentation about OpenstreetMap was given during ICSET 2018.
        On November 3, 2018, OSM Kerala community member User:Naveenpf met with Biju, e-governance engineer at the Public Works Department to discuss releasing KSTP data. Efforts were made to create a road project and building project for Wayanad.
        OSM Kerala volunteers participated in a KSITM KSDI's Mapathon Kerala project community consultation held on March 8, 2019, which was a pre-consultation on crowdsourcing data for OSM.
