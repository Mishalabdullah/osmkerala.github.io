# Report of event participation

Event was jointly organised by KILA and ULTS.
Joy Elaman (KILA director) briefed about the importance of GIS and welcomed the participants. Dr Harilal inaugurated the event and briefed about the history of GIS in Kerala.

Nizamuddin (Kerala landuse board and KSREC) gave a demo on (https://kattakadalac.com/). Project has collected lot of data in that LAC. He also explained plans of expanding that project. When asked about releasing that as opendata, there was no response in the chat.

Both Jake (ULTS) and Sreekandan (GPK,Karakulam) explained how they done LSGDâ€™s IPMS project. ULTS had kept the personal data open for a while. Once the issue was raised, it has been rectified. GPK has a staging server. Personal data is open right now. Sreekandan has conveyed that in the next release it will be accessible only to LSG authority. It would very good if IMPS geo data is released under opendata. Geo Data developed by ULTS is based on drone mapping. OpenStreetMap Kerala community should contact LSG department and ask to release relevant data as opendata. Otherwise both IPMS project and Mapathon Kerala (from IT Dept) are trying to duplicate the data. And it is a waste of public fund. IPMS is hosting website local for each LSGD.

In the end, Monish Jose (Assistant professor, KILA) explained on the usage of GIS in LSGs. KILA mainly trains LSG officials/staff on GIS and plan based on GIS. There was a description of activities KILA was doing in GIS. He explained the need for contacting citizen mappers.

There was no QA session. #IPMS
