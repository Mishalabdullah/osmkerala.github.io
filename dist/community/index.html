Twenty-three volunteers from OSM community, MG University, Swathandra Malayalam Computing attended the mapping party to map the areas of Koorachundu Panchayat, Kozhikode, Kerala. This was hosted by the Panchayat in an aim to prepare a ward-level map for the upcoming LSGI election. Koorachundu Panchayat Mapathon was the first of its kind that a government body in India (documented) took an initiative to host an event to create a map on a community level. This paved the way for many mapping events to happen from the government side.

This was organized, gaining energy from Koorachundu Panchayat Mapathon. In response to the State Election Commission's instructions, to draw a map of Unnikulam Grama Panchayat with ward boundaries, potential polling booths, and other features, a mapping exercise was conducted. Student volunteer participants from a college nearby surveyed the area upon the instructions of Jaisen Nedumpala. The data collected from the field was processed from the Grama Panchayat office by the volunteers. The data was then processed, uploaded to OSM, and made a ward map of Unnikulamgp grama panchayat, and was duly submitted to the State Election Commission.

During the flood, developers in Kerala came together to make keralarescue.in and microid.in/keralaflood. Both helped a lot during the flood. Both used OpenStreetMap data.
					keralaresuce.in - Requests for help were collected, organized, and shown in maps for help to reach.
					microid.in/keralaflood - A map to see the flooded roads. Useful while traveling.

During the Kerala floods 2018, there was a lot of data addition. The Kerala community approached HOTOSM and created tasks for the affected region. Road and building tasks were created for Thrissur, Ernakulam, Pathanamthitta, Wayanad, Alleppey, Idukki districts. The community reached out to companies like Microsoft, Grab, Amazon Logistics, Mapbox for support. Maxar Technologies (Digital Globe) released satellite imagery through their Open data program.

OSM Kerala community reached out to Facebook during floods to help map in Kerala. Facebook agreed to help. Facebook has released an open dataset of ML detected roads from high-resolution imagery for the entire state following a request from the community. Road import was done by the collaboration of Facebook with the community.

Association with FOSSers of Vidya Academy of Science & Technology, HOTOSM, OSM Kerala Community, and various organizations for our first Mapathon during Kerala Flood 2018. The goal was to complete mapping for three taluks: Mukundapuram, Chalakkudy, and Thrissur. We had 36 volunteers who registered through Google forms. In less than 5 hours of work, we were able to achieve impressive results: 4,388 edits, 2,799 buildings, 118 km of roads, and mapping of lakes, streams, and more.

As an extension of a previous mapping party held at Koorachundu Panchayath in 2014, the panchayat decided to host another mapping event to create a rich resource map. National Service Scheme volunteers from three colleges camped in the panchayat from December 22 to 28, 2018. A total of 220 student volunteers were trained to map with OSM. The technical support for the event was provided by OSM Kerala community, Swathantra Malayalam Computing, and Geominds. Various features were added to OSM, focusing on Place Names, Roads, Lanes, Culverts, Bridges, Land Use/Land Cover, Building Footprints, Drinking Water Schemes, Forests, Streams, Rivers, Hot Springs, Ponds, Public Wells, Water Tanks, Tourist, Religious and Recreational Spots, Irrigation, Public Health Systems, and Other Assets. Areas affected by floods and landslides were mapped from a disaster management perspective.

Members of the OSM Kerala community advocated for the improvement of OSM data in Kerala following the floods in 2018. The community submitted proposals to release important datasets under an OpenData license. Community members reached out to various government officials, including Minister Dr. Thomas Isaac and MLAs like Sabarinathan, Veena George, Shafi Parambil, and VD Satheesan. They also engaged with Potheri Vasudevan Unnikrishnan, Strategic Advisor at the Kerala Development Innovation Strategic Council.
        On August 28, 2018, a proposal to the Kerala government for releasing data for use in OSM was jointly written by community members in OSM Kerala and friends in CIS. The proposal was submitted to the then IT Secretary, IT Mission director, and ICFOSS Director. In-person meetings were held to discuss the proposal.
        Parallel efforts were made to create the Kerala OpenData portal, which was discussed with the then IT Mission Director Sambasiva Rao by OSM Kerala community member User:Naveenpf. A presentation about OpenstreetMap was given during ICSET 2018.
        On November 3, 2018, OSM Kerala community member User:Naveenpf met with Biju, e-governance engineer at the Public Works Department to discuss releasing KSTP data. Efforts were made to create a road project and building project for Wayanad.
        OSM Kerala volunteers participated in a KSITM KSDI's Mapathon Kerala project community consultation held on March 8, 2019, which was a pre-consultation on crowdsourcing data for OSM.
